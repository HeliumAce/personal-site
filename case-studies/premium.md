## Context

In 2019, I was asked to lead the end-to-end experience of the Free and Premium plans for Jira and Confluence. This was a complex project spanning multiple teams and geos across Atlassian. Prior to this effort, Atlassian only offered a single, per user pricing tier, which was a barrier to entry for many potential cloud customers.

### Before
Prior to this effort, Atlassian only offered a single, per user pricing tier.

### After
To open the funnel and attract more customers to the cloud, we introduced Free and Premium plans.

### Star diagrams
Simple star diagrams were created to better align and understand the scope of the effort. These simple outputs are a great way to understand the scope of an effort without getting caught up in specific UI or implementation details.

### Prioritizing the work
There was no single team assigned to this effort. To ensure experience quality and consistency, I needed a commitment from across the organization to prioritize this work. The email below was shared with design leaders from across Atlassian. In it, I outline what we would need to be successful, and what they could expect to see in return.

### Roles & responsibilities
When I joined this effort, my role and responsibilities were not very well defined. I was Atlassian's first principal designer on one of our most complex programs of work.  To ensure my expectations were aligned with the various teams and stakeholders, I drafted a JD for the role and asked for feedback from across the organization.

### High-level process
We used this simple diagram to align on our weekly, monthly and quarterly team processes and rituals.

### E2E journeys
The bulk of this effort was to define the end-to-end journeys during a series of cross-team, cross-functional workshops. These journeys provided a single source of truth across teams and ensured that our deliverables were aligned across the organization.

### Experience risks
Using the journeys as our foundation, we were able to identify and mitigate experience risks across the program of work. This included a number of clean escalations and tough go / no-go milestones.

### Clean escalations
Some of the tougher moments were when we needed to step in front of a high-priority experience risk and run a clean escalation. Although these were difficult conversations, they were made easier by the shared understanding we'd developed across teams through the journey lens.

### Setting & maintaining a high experience quality bar
In addition to owning the overall experience, I was also responsible for ensuring that the experience quality was maintained across the program of work. This included working with design teams across Atlassian and occassionally stepping in to collaborate on a specific experience or feature.

### Closing thoughts
This was one of the most complex programs of work I've been involved with. It required a high level of alignment and collaboration across Atlassian. I'm proud of the work we delivered and the impact it had on the business.

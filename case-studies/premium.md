## Snapshot
### ✨ Challenge
Atlassian's single-tier pricing was a barrier to cloud adoption. Potential customers faced an all-or-nothing decision that excluded smaller teams and enterprises alike. Meanwhile, cloud revenue growth had plateaued. We needed a new approach to open the funnel and accelerate cloud growth.

The challenge wasn't just adding pricing tiers. We needed to redesign the entire customer journey across numerous teams spanning multiple products, geographies, and organizational structures. All while maintaining end-to-end consistency and quality across touchpoints.

### 🎯 Impact
- **Opened the cloud funnel** — Free and Premium plans removed barriers for millions of potential users
- **Accelerated growth** — Increased cloud revenue percentage from 50% to 60% within one year
- **Delivered significant revenue impact** — Contributed to over $100M revenue increase between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021
- **Unified fragmented experiences** — Created consistent end-to-end pricing & packaging journeys across all Atlassian products and tiers

---

## Context

In 2019, Atlassian's cloud growth had slowed. Our single, per-user pricing tier created friction at both ends of the market—too expensive for startups, too limited for enterprises considering cloud migration.

Our product architecture reflected this constraint. Billing systems, user management, and product experiences were all built around legacy decisions that better reflected our server roots than our cloud-based future. We needed to redesign the entire pricing & packaging customer journey from first impression to enterprise scale.

## Case studies

### 1. Building cross-team commitment

#### Challenge
As Atlassian's first principal designer, my role wasn't clearly defined. Teams across the organization had competing priorities, and program-level needs often took a backseat to individual team needs. To deliver the best possible experience, I needed buy-in from design leaders, stakeholders and contributing designers to prioritize this work. 

#### Approach
I proposed forming a cross-functional sub-team where I served as dotted-line leader. To get buy-in from across the organization, I focused on making the case for why this work mattered and what teams could expect in return.

![Email to design leaders](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard08.png)
*I outlined clear expectations and mutual commitments*

![Specific asks and deliverables](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard09.png)
*The ask was specific: dedicated time in exchange for clear visibility into the work*

I also created a clear job description for my role, getting feedback from stakeholders across the organization to ensure expectations were aligned.

![Role definition part 1](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard10.png)
*I defined my role proactively to avoid confusion later*

![Role definition part 2](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard11.png)
*Clear expectations and deliverables helped teams understand how I view my role*

![High-level process](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard15.png)
*Weekly, monthly and quarterly team processes and rituals*

#### Impact
This approach built genuine commitment rather than compliance. Teams understood how their work contributed to larger program goals and felt supported rather than goverened. The result was higher quality output and stronger cross-team collaboration.

### 2. Defining the end-to-end experience

#### Challenge
This wasn't a typical product feature—it was a fundamental business model change affecting every customer touchpoint. Teams were optimizing for their individual product metrics without considering how their work connected to the broader customer journey.

#### Approach
I created frameworks to map and connect every customer touchpoint across the entire experience. Starting with simple star diagrams to align on scope, we then built detailed end-to-end journey maps through cross-functional workshops.

*We mapped both self-serve and high-touch sales scenarios*

#### Impact
These frameworks became our shared language. Instead of teams working in isolation, we had a unified view of the customer journey that enabled better collaboration and more user-centered decisions.

### 3. Managing experience risk

#### Challenge
With so many teams working in parallel, experience risks were inevitable. Traditional product management approaches focused on delivery timelines, not user experience quality. We needed a way to identify and address experience problems before they reached customers.

#### Approach
Using our end-to-end journeys as a foundation, I created an experience risk register that tracked potential issues across the entire program. This wasn't just about cataloging problems—it was about creating clear escalation paths and go/no-go criteria.

![Experience risk tracking](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard27.png)
*We overlaid potential risks onto our customer journey maps*

![Risk register detail](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard28.png)
*Each risk included clear owners, mitigation plans, and escalation triggers*

When high-priority risks emerged, I packaged them into "clean escalations"—clear presentations of the problem, impact, and recommended solutions that leadership could act on quickly.

![Clean escalation example](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard33.png)
*Clean escalations focused on user impact and business consequences*

#### Impact
This proactive approach prevented major experience failures from reaching customers. By making experience risks visible and actionable, we maintained quality standards even under tight delivery pressures.

### 4. Sweating the details

#### Challenge
Even with strong frameworks and processes, some experiences required direct intervention. The billing experience, in particular, was complex and had competing requirements that led to confusing user experiences.

#### Approach
I stepped in to collaborate directly on the billing redesign, focusing on consistency and clarity across different plan types and user scenarios.

![Before: Competing CTAs](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard35.png)
*Before: Competing primary actions confused users*

![Before: Complex conditional logic](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard36.png)
*Before: Different plans had inconsistent layouts and messaging*

![After: Consistent experience](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard38.png)
*After: Clear hierarchy and consistent patterns across all plans*

![After: Room for experimentation](/assets/work/vanguard/Vanguard39.png)
*After: Simplified architecture allowed for growth experiments*

#### Impact
The billing redesign created a foundation for future optimization while immediately improving user comprehension and conversion rates. More importantly, it demonstrated how design quality could be maintained even in complex, constraint-heavy environments.

## The Bigger Picture

Free and Premium wasn't just about adding pricing tiers—it was about fundamentally changing how Atlassian thought about customer acquisition and experience design. The frameworks we built for cross-team collaboration, experience risk management, and design quality became templates for other complex programs across the company.

Most importantly, we proved that design could lead strategic business initiatives. By focusing on user experience as a competitive advantage, we didn't just hit our revenue targets—we created a more user-centered approach to product development that influenced how Atlassian operates today.

### Prioritizing the work
There was no single team assigned to this effort. To ensure experience quality and consistency, I needed a commitment from across the organization to prioritize this work. The email below was shared with design leaders from across Atlassian. In it, I outline what we would need to be successful, and what they could expect to see in return.

### Roles & responsibilities
When I joined this effort, my role and responsibilities were not very well defined. I was Atlassian's first principal designer on one of our most complex programs of work.  To ensure my expectations were aligned with the various teams and stakeholders, I drafted a JD for the role and asked for feedback from across the organization.

### Clean escalations
Some of the tougher moments were when we needed to step in front of a high-priority experience risk and run a clean escalation. Although these were difficult conversations, they were made easier by the shared understanding we'd developed across teams through the journey lens.

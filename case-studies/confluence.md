## Summary

## Confluence's Next Play
In collaboration with my cross-functional partners and Atlassian's executive team, we developed a 6-pager strategy to reinvent Confluence. Our goal was to reinvent Confluence as a modern, collaborative workspace for every team. Confluence's Next Play would guide the next 3+ years of development.

## Show, don't tell
We asked a small team of designers to compliment Confluence's Next Play with a light-weight envisioning effort. The goal of the effort was to render our strategy and to align and inspire our team.

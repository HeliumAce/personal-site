## Snapshot
### ✨ Highlights
Trello was growing fast but its experience was fragmenting. Our team had nearly doubled in size while simultaneously experiencing significant turnover as many original Trellists moved on to new challenges. Meanwhile, rapid feature development across multiple squads aimed at monetizing our established user base was making our product experience inconsistent and negatively impacting our users.

We faced a multi-part challenge: scale our team, operationalize design quality, and grow our bottom line—all while preserving what made Trello special.
### 🎯 Impact
- **Operationalized experience quality** — Increased CSAT from 86% to 89% and our cross-functional "Proud to Ship" metric from 45% to 55%
- **Built lasting team culture** — Developed a design team charter, purpose, and values that became the bedrock of our culture for 3+ years
- **Connected fragmented work** — Delivered a visual roadmap and vision for the future of Trello that aligned squads and inspired our team and stakeholders
- **Drove revenue impact** — Contributed to increased revenue through revamped Premium and Enterprise plans

## Case studies

> 📢 Atlassian recently launched <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/trello">Trello 2.0</a>, reflecting many foundations we established during my tenure.

### 1. Operationalizing experience quality

#### Challenge
Experience quality, historically Trello's strength, was slipping. We were in a feature race and squads were optimizing for speed over quality. There was no clear definition of what "quality" meant across the organization and we lacked incentives for teams to prioritize it.

#### Approach
I led an effort to operationalize experience quality across Trello by treating it like any other core business metric. Through a shared cross-functional OKR, I incentivized teams to make quality a priority. We set clear expectations for squads and delegated ownership of quality key results across the organization.

*Key results were measured through CSAT, performance metrics, and accessibility scores*

#### Impact
This effort directly contributed to a 3% increase in CSAT and a 10% improvement in our internal "Proud to Ship" metric. More importantly, quality became an integral part of how every team measured success. By making this a cross-functional goal rather than a design-only initiative, we distributed ownership and made quality everyone's responsibility.

### 2. Design team charter
When I joined Trello as Head of Design, the team was growing fast. There had been significant recent turnover, and many new designers were joining the team. To ensure we retained the incredible culture the team had built over previous years, I planned and led a workshop to define our purpose, values, and goals. The output of this workshop was a design team charter that became a cornerstone of our culture for the next 3+ years.

### 3. Visual roadmap
During a period of rapid new feature development, our product experience started to fragment. To connect the dots across squads and inspire the organization, we tasked a small cross-functional team with delivering a visual roadmap. This visual roadmap became a key artifact for the organization to develop a shared understanding of the product vision and align around the future of Trello.

### 4. What if, Trello?
Building off the success of our visual roadmap, we set out to deliver a more ambitious vision for the future of Trello. What If, Trello? asked the design team to imagine not what Trello is today, but what Trello could become. We used this exercise not only as a way to inspire and motivate our immediate team but also to generate a set of ideas that provoked new thinking and conversations with our executive team and founders.

### 5. Design leadership roles & responsibilities
During my time leading design at Trello, I was responsible for defining the roles and responsibilities for the design leadership group, which was composed of both managers and ICs. With an organizational emphasis on experience quality, we explored new ways to empower principal designers to raise the quality bar across the organization. This model clearly defined those roles and responsibilities.

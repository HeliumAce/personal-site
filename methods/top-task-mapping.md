This was a method I developed to help me understand the opportunities for machine learning at Atlassian. This method juxtaposed a set of top tasks against a future of work framework borrowed from the book "The Adaptation Advantage" by Heather E. McGowan and Chris Shipley. Through this exercise I was able to identify a POV on the opportunities for automation, atomization, and augmentation across Atlassian's key verticals. Below is a snapshot of the method and outputs.

## Object-oriented UX

### Certification

I recently completed the Object-Oriented UX strategist certification. Following the ORCA (Objects, Relationships, CTAs, Attributes) process, OOUX offers a repeatable, pragmatic approach to delivering high-quality, consistent experiences by focusing on nouns before verbs. Having baked the ORCA process into my recent client work, I'm looking forward to sharing this process with in-house product teams.

### Object models

Although recently certified in OOUX, I've been using a similar approach to unpacking a product's objects and relationships throughout my career. When joining a new team, these models offer an accerlerated understanding of the product and domain while also assisting with alignment across design, product, and engineering teams.

## Billing models
During the push to deliver Atlassian Enterprise plans, we struggled with the complexity and inconsistency of Atlassan product architecture and billing systems. Atlassian had a product mix that included pure SaaS products that were billed on a per-user basis, such as Bitbucket and Trello, and also products that belonged to a multi-product site, such as Jira and Confluence. The site-based model was a remnant of Atlassian's original server-side business.

The following models were created to simplify the problem space and propose a path forward. The solution proposed unified, per-user billing and the dissolution of the site-based model. It would take years of iteration to achieve, but eventually, Atlassian products would align on this as the correct path forward.

## Summary

This page collects systems thinking methods and artifacts I've developed over the years to understand complex products and domains quickly.

## Object models

Object models provide x-ray vision into the structure and relationships between primary objects within a system. They're invaluable for onboarding to new product areas and often unlock innovative product experiences that might otherwise be missed.

**Use this method when you need to:**
- Quickly understand a new product or domain
- Accelerate kickoff and initial designs for new products
- Generate novel ideas for displaying objects or views
- Build alignment with developers

*Credit: Much of this method comes from former mentor and stellar designer [Guillaume Thoreau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumethoreau/).*

### Bitbucket

These object models were created early in my Bitbucket tenure. What made them unique was defining not only the primary objects and relationships within our product, but also how they relate to Git's native objects.

## Billing models

During Atlassian's push to deliver Enterprise plans, we struggled with complex, inconsistent product architecture and billing systems. Atlassian had a mixed product portfolio: pure SaaS products billed per-user (like Bitbucket and Trello) and products belonging to multi-product sites (like Jira and Confluence). The site-based model was a remnant of Atlassian's server-side origins.

These models simplified the problem space and proposed a path forward: unified per-user billing and dissolution of the site-based model. While it took years to achieve, Atlassian eventually aligned on this direction.

## Object-oriented UX

### Certification

I recently completed the Object-Oriented UX strategist certification. Following the ORCA (Objects, Relationships, CTAs, Attributes) process, OOUX offers a repeatable, pragmatic approach to delivering high-quality, consistent experiences by focusing on nouns before verbs. Having integrated the ORCA process into recent client work, I'm excited to share this approach with in-house product teams.

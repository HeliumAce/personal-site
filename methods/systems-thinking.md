## Summary

Much of my design practice has been rooted in systems thinking. This page includes a collection of systems thinking methods and artefacts that I've developed over the years.

## Object models

Object models offer a practical method for understanding the objects within a system and the relationship between them. When joining a new team, I've found these models offer an accelerated understanding of the product and domain while also assisting with alignment across design, product, and engineering teams.

Much of the credit for the models shown here goes to a former mentor and stellar design, [Guillaume Thoreau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumethoreau/). 

### Bitbucket

Joining Bitbucket in 2015 presented a set of unique challenges as a designer and leader. Not only was the design team

## Billing models
During the push to deliver Atlassian Enterprise plans, we struggled with the complexity and inconsistency of Atlassan product architecture and billing systems. Atlassian had a product mix that included pure SaaS products that were billed on a per-user basis, such as Bitbucket and Trello, and also products that belonged to a multi-product site, such as Jira and Confluence. The site-based model was a remnant of Atlassian's original server-side business.

The following models were created to simplify the problem space and propose a path forward. The solution proposed unified, per-user billing and the dissolution of the site-based model. It would take years of iteration to achieve, but eventually, Atlassian products would align on this as the correct path forward.

## Object-oriented UX

### Certification

I recently completed the Object-Oriented UX strategist certification. Following the ORCA (Objects, Relationships, CTAs, Attributes) process, OOUX offers a repeatable, pragmatic approach to delivering high-quality, consistent experiences by focusing on nouns before verbs. Having baked the ORCA process into my recent client work, I'm looking forward to sharing this process with in-house product teams.

This page represents a collection of techniques I've developed to communicate customer flows and journeys. Each of these has broad applicability when kicking off a new project or to take a step back and ensure a team is aligned on the overall direction of their work.

## E2E blueprints

This journey framework is effective and fun to work with. I've used this to map out journeys as a solo designer but it's most valuable when tackling a complex program of work as a team. Great for mapping out multiple touchpoints, surfaces, and a mix of low-touch and high-touch interactions.

## Starman diagrams

I've been using starman diagrams as a sort of visual user story for decades. They can be incredibly useful as both a conceptual tool as well as to visualize user stories without getting distracted by screen-level details.

## Experience maps

Experience maps help designers and teams visualize a complete product or experience narrative. I found these most useful working in the gaming space at EA and Ubisoft as a means of connecting the dots across large systems spanning product and game play ideas.

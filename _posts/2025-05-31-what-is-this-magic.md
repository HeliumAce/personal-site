My career is littered with failed attempts at learning to code. Bootcamps, the Odin Project, countless scrappy prototypes. My local Projects directory tells the story of someone who kept getting close but always hit the wall.

Through all those efforts, I became what I'd call a reasonably technical product designer. A tinkerer. A wannabe maker. But building something real, something others could actually use, maybe even pay for? That has always remained just out of reach.

My first encounter with this latest wave of AI was on an Amtrak traveling from New York a few years back. A friend from Google showed me the original Dall-E on his phone, generating mostly grotesque mashups that were fascinating despite their unusable quality. We spent the next three hours making and sharing silly images, addicted to that simple magic of going from prompt to output.

Generative AI slowly evolved from toy to tool over the next couple years, creeping into my work and personal life. The last 6 months though was when I truly felt everything start to change.

### AI and an 8-year-old

I'd been wrestling with my personal site for weeks, starting and stopping, switching between no-code tools and hand-coding attempts, frustrated by the limitations of templates and site builders. Then one morning I found myself exploring Cursors' AI agent.

This was my light switch moment.

Suddenly my ideas flowed onto screen like ink on paper. I was exploring new languages, breaking and fixing code, trying things that had been completely out of reach. It was as close to magic as anything I'd experienced throughout all my years in tech. I was hooked.

The following weekend, my 8-year-old daughter woke up with an idea: a website to help people find the perfect cat breed and learn how to care for them. Six hours later, with my daughter, Claude, and Lovable at my side, Cat Breed Explorer was live. A simple but powerful case study on just how much the world had suddenly changed.  

Could I have built this before? Technically, yes. Would it have taken weeks? Absolutely. Would it have ever actually happened? No chance.

That's when I started to question what was really happening here. This wasn't just AI writing code for me while I slept through the process. I felt *more* connected with what I was building, not less. Despite many authors' concerns about the switch to autopilot, I'd become more curious, more engaged.

### Leaning in, not out

For the past few weeks I've been ruminating on the collaborative strengths of AI from which a few themes have emerged:

**AI amplifies what you already know.** Years of designing screens, thinking through user experience needs, problem-solving. All of it gets supercharged. Those half-finished coding tutorials and scrappy prototypes weren't wasted effort. They're the foundation I'm finally able to build upon with AI by my side. 

**With AI, doing is learning.** I'm not learning to code in the traditional sense, but I am learning how code works. Every day spent building teaches me something new about logic, structure, and possibility. When I don't understand how something works, I simply ask. It's accelerated "learn by doing" by an order of magnitude.

**AI rewards engaged collaboration.** The best moments happen when I'm actively engaged. Asking questions, reviewing options, making decisions, iterating on ideas. When I check out and let AI drive, things are more likely to break and results are generic. When I bring my own taste, intuition, and curiousity to each step, that's when the magic happens.

### Capturing the moment

Just as AI is evolving, so am I. From a designer who works on technology to a technologist with a background in design. I've heard this called a generalist specialist, a curious builder. Whatever you call it, it's the most fun I've had tinkering and making in my entire career.

This is the first of hopefully many more posts. Letters to myself to document the joy of making and building with AI, and to think through what it all means. To appreciate, and interrogate, this very special moment in time.

So what is this magic? I'm writing to find out.
